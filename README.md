# Loan_Analysis
To monitor our bank's lending performance, we need a comprehensive Bank Loan Report. This report will provide insights into key loan metrics, track portfolio health, and highlight trends over time. It supports data-driven decisions and helps refine our lending strategies.

### Data Sources

Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "financial_loan.csv" file, which contains detailed loan information.

### Tools

- Excel - Data Cleaning
- SQL Server - Data Analysis
- PowerBI - Creating reports

### Data Cleaning/Preparation

- Handling missing values.
- Data cleaning and formatting.
